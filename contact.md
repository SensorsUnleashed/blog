Hi and welcome!

You have entered the Sensors Unleashed project blog.
My name is Ole Nissen, and I am the founder of the project. I have a Bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering, and I have been working as a software developer for the last 10+ years. Most of my work has been with embedded software, but also with higher level software like Java, Js, C# etc.

I am currently working as a Software Architect at a Danish Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) [Delfigroup](http://delfi-group.com/en/) and even though my day job is working with electronics and software, my spare time is used for more or less the same - when ever I can, that is.

I live in a small village in the southern part of Denmark with my wife and my 2 daughters (2 and 5).

If you like to get in touch, donate to my work or would like to ask me anything, feel free to contact me at:
