The Sensors Unleashed project started 1. December 2015.

It basically started one day I turned on the radio. A guy was talking about taking the bus to save the earth some CO2. As noble as it may seem, I wondered how much he was actually saving by taking the bus. I for one, wouldn't take the bus, unless I had some number indicating how much saving it would mean.
I started to wonder, if it was always like that. If e.g. when I take a shower, I can stand in there for a very long time. Its nice and the hot water doesn't seem to have an end. BUT, if it went cold, because I did not hurry - that would make me hurry. So if I could create a system that could measure real life, set some criteria and act on them, I could make all kinds of crazy setups, in no time.

The main purpose of this project, is to create a platform, that allows us all to create the applications that we want, fast and as advanced as we want.

# The Mission
Think, Invent, Present, Again!!

# Donate
As soon as I have the basic hardware platform in place, I'm planning on recruiting more team members. To attract team members, I'm willing to give away hardware, that will help get the new members going. Hopefully, this can attract some very skilled and eager folks that can innovate and think new setups that will benefit the rest of us.
All donations made to me, will go directly to the community, so, if you think this project is exciting, but you don't have any technical skills, please consider donating. I'm also planning on creating a poll, where you can vote for a specific feature that you find important.

I will receive paypal and bitcoins.
