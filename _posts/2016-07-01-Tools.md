When building a open source project the tools used are pretty important. What good is open source, if it takes a significant amount of money to get started. Besides, most software is available for free and most in a nice quality. This post will explain the rationale behind the tool choices.

## Software:
In this area there is absolutely no need to go for expensive software. Even in my daily work as software developer there is no need to go for it. Actually the opposite -
The other day I was asked to maintain a legacy application made for windows XP. The software was developed back in 2007, and back then the software developer which started the project, had chosen to go with the Embarcadero Software C++ software suite. The compiler and ide was properly top notch back then, but today this particular suite is no more. The firm behind the compiler had been sold a couple of time between then and now, and our customer didn't have a copy laying around. Long story short - I succeeded to get it again, but only if I bought a new license for 4000â‚¬!! This is exactly where for instance GCC shines. I am able to get the exact version of the compiler used just from a simple google search.

For Sensors unleashed I use GCC for everything (At least compiled software).
* CC2538 embedded software: The CC2538 has a regular arm M3 core and is supported just fine by GCC.
* Setup Tool: Made with QT > 5.6. My primary platform is Linux and therefore QT is almost always compiled using GCC.
* Applications. When I start making customized software i will consider using higher level software. I especilly like Python for this kind of work. The code looks nice, and there is already a bunch of nice modules to import.
