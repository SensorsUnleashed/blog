# Me
My name is Ole Nissen. I live in Denmark with my wife and my 2 daugthers. I have a B.Sc.E.E degree, and I have been working for the last 10 years as a software developer. I am currently working as a Software Architect at a danish Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) [Delfigroup](http://delfi-group.com/en/).

# The project
The Sensors Unleashed project started 1. december 2015. I heard a guy talking on the radio about taking the bus, because that would to save the earth some CO2. As noble as it may seem, I wondered how much he was actually saving by taking the bus. I for one, wouldn't take the bus, unless I had some number indicating how much good it would do.
I started to wonder, if it was always like that. If eg. when I take a shower, I can stand in there for a very long time. Its nice, and the hot water doesn't seem to have an end. BUT, if it went cold, because I did not hurry - that would make me hurry. So if I could create a system that could measure real life, set some criterias, and act on them. I could make all kind of cracy setups, in no time.

The main purpose of this project, is to create a platform, that allows us all to create the applications that we want, as advanced as we want.

# The Mission
Think, Invent, Present, Again!!
